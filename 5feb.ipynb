    "\n",
    "Encapsulation: It involves bundling the data (attributes) and the methods that operate on the data into a single unit known as a class. Access to the data is restricted to within the class, and it can be controlled through methods.\n",

    "Abstraction: It refers to the process of hiding the complex implementation details and showing only the relevant features of an object. Abstraction allows you to focus on what an object does rather than how it achieves its functionality.\n",

    "Polymorphism: It allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common base class. Polymorphism can take various forms, such as method overloading (same method name with different parameters) and method overriding (same method name in both the base and derived class).\"\"\""
